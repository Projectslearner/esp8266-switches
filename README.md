# ESP8266 Switches Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface a push button with an ESP8266 microcontroller to detect button presses. This simple setup can be used in various applications where user input is required, such as controlling LEDs, relays, or navigating menus.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller (NodeMCU)**
- **Push Button**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Push Button to ESP8266:**
   - Connect one terminal of the push button to GPIO pin D1 on the ESP8266.
   - Connect the other terminal of the push button to ground (GND).
   - Ensure a common ground (GND) connection between the ESP8266 and the push button.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 for debugging purposes.
   - Configure the button pin (D1) as an input with an internal pull-up resistor using `pinMode()`. This ensures that the pin reads HIGH when the button is not pressed and LOW when the button is pressed.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the `loop()` function:
     - Read the state of the button using `digitalRead()`.
     - Print the button state to the Serial Monitor.
     - Add a small delay of 100 milliseconds to debounce the button and avoid false readings.

#### Applications
- **User Input Devices:** Detect button presses to control various devices or navigate through menus.
- **Switch Monitoring:** Monitor the state of a switch for various control applications.
- **Interactive Projects:** Use push buttons in interactive projects where user input is required.

#### Notes
- **Debouncing:** The delay of 100 milliseconds helps debounce the button, ensuring accurate readings by preventing multiple signals from a single press.
- **Serial Output:** Use the Serial Monitor to observe the button state changes and verify the correct operation of the push button.
